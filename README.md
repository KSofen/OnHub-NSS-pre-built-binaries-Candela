The NSS patches for OnHub compiled with source code from the OpenWrt 23.05.5 (kernel 5.15.185), and NSS patches by @Kong, @ACwifidude and @vochong --
Final CT (Candela Technologies) drivers support Fast Roaming, but can't reliably support MESH.  Last best firmware for OnHub routers.
This firmware pushes the OnHub to the maximum speed and throughput the hardware is capable of producing.  No more updates to follow.
OnHub routers are far past end of life.  OpenWrt release firmware still supports OnHub, but not NSS hardware.  Use at your own risk.
